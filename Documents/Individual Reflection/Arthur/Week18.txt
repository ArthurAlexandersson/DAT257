##Week 18##
Denna weekly-reflection blev p√• engelska :) 

For this week I mostly worked on the popup-window which displays some tips on how to prevent fires
and what to do in case of a fire. Working with this I encountered some issues. For example how to 
link the different functionality between files, such as opening and closing the view, aswell as how to 
make it look like a popup which is placed above everything else. I figured out how to fix all this and 
it was satisfying to see it all work in the end. 

I also worked on implementing functionality which centeres the map when pressing a fire in the priority 
view. This was also quite challenging, but I at last got it to work somewhat smoothly, there're still some
issues where the center is somewhat missplaced. 

For the next week I plan to work more on the aesthetics of the website. I'm also going to be helping out with
the filtering and search functionality.
