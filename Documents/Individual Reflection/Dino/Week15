Week 15:

I would like to understand better how it is to work in agile due to the fact that I in the summer will be working for a company that works agile.
I would like to understand Scrum better due to the previous reason where I will be working in CI team during the summer in the company.
Having open communication has helped, even though there was a bit of miscommunication during the week where one member unfortunetly went to campus and the rest stayed home for the meeting.
Having a clearer communication is a way for us all to improve.
