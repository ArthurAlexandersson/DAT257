Week 16:

This week has been a productive week, we have finished the desired user stories and are continuing to learn how to work agile.
We have been working with the Google api to extract data from both latitude and longitude of data. 
I am interested to see how effective the process of working in a large group and working agile at the same time. 
We have been working on different branches that we later merge by the end of the week. 
What could be improved for next week is yet again better communication and dividing different tasks/user stories.
