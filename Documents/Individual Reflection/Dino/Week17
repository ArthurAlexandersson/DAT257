Week 17:

This week has been a bumpy week. I have been trying to get the searchbars 'suggestion' functionality to work. When a user types in a Country/City/Region, 
a combobox is supposed to appear with suggestion. The initial idea was that the searchbar should have an autocomplete function. 
The library that was intended for this ideal is currently not working. The searchbar itself looks good however the underlying functionality (api calls) is currently not working. 
This user story will be a priority next week. Otherwise the setting of working agile has been better than previously thought. 
Having three meetings every week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday helps with the iteraitons for each sprint (the user stories that is). 
I would like to better understand how to integrate different api services from google maps/locations that makes the UX better.
