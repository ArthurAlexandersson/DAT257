Week 19 individual report:

This week we finalized the project. We have finally finished the search bar and its functionality. 
It was a bit tiresome of a task mainly because the google autocomplete and map apis did not work well together.
Instead we looked into other options and luckily we found something called geocode which was made it a lot easier to implement 
the funcitonality of searching different countries in the search bar. It incorporates using the actual geographical locations of the
different sites. 

To summarize this week, we have even more so worked as a team as many of us have worked together to finish different tasks. 
Also I belive that I have understood the importance of working agile. It was a good project and the project in of itself has given
me an insight in how it is to work agile to recieve a finished product in the end. It was also a good experience to teach one self
Javascript and React as they are the language and framework that are used most extensively in web development.
