## Week 18 Oscar Karbin ##

This week, I focused on completing the react router pages for our project and participated in all meetings, 
although our week was slightly shortened due to the May 1st holiday. 
However, I wasn't able to work on Friday because I was in the process of moving to a new place. 
Despite this setback, I'm proud of the progress we made this week and look forward to continuing our work on the project in the coming weeks.
