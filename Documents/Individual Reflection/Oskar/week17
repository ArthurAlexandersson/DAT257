## Oscar Karbin week 17##

In week 17, I focused on finalizing the custom markers and ensuring their compatibility with future updates. 
Additionally, I began working with React Router to create new "pages," enabling us to develop sections such as 
"About Us" and "Home." This effort also contributed to enhancing the overall project structure. 
Moreover, I maintained consistent engagement with the team by attending all scheduled meetings throughout the week.
