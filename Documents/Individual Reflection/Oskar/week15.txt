## Oscar Karbin Week 15##

This week I spent most of the time setting up the IDE that will be used in this project. This is important 
because it is the foundation of the project. I also participated in meetings where we discussed different
APIs we are planning to use. However I did miss the meeting on Monday because of unstable internet while
traveling. This required me to ask for a summary of the missed meeting.
