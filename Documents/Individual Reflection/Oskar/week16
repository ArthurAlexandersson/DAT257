## Oscar Karbin Week 15##

During week 16, I dedicated a significant amount of time to developing custom "fire" Google markers that will replace the default markers to better align with 
our project's theme. Additionally, I designed the initial prototype of our website using Figma, which provided valuable insight into the desired styling and layout. 
Furthermore, I actively participated in all meetings scheduled for this week, ensuring consistent communication and collaboration with the team.
