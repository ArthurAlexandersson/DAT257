## Week 19 individual reflection Oscar Karbin ##
During week 19, my main focus was on styling the footer for our project. However, upon further review and discussions with my team, we decided that having a footer was unnecessary and added clutter to the page. 
As a result, I made the decision to remove the footer entirely. The information that was previously located in the footer has now been placed within the navbar.

In addition to working on the footer, I actively participated in all the scheduled meetings, ensuring that I remained up to date with the team's progress and contributed to the discussions.

Looking ahead to next week, my goal is to improve some of the user stories we have in the bank and break down larger user stories into smaller more manageable tasks. 
By doing this, I hope to bring more clarity to the development process and ensure that our team can work more effectively towards achieving our goals.
